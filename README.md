### Abstract
Characterizing individual variation in parental care is critical to understanding how selection shapes and maintains patterns of care, yet little is known about how individual parents vary in their responses to the environment. Reaction norms, functions that describe how phenotypes change across an environmental gradient, provide an elegant framework for studying individual variation in behavioural responses. We use a reaction norm approach to investigate how studying plasticity, which describes variation within an individual through time, and personality, which describes repeatable variation among individuals, together explain individual variation in the parental behaviour of the anemonefish Amphiprion percula. More specifically, we test how resource availability influences individual parental responses to the environment and discuss the consequences for our understanding of plasticity and personality in parental care. Breeding pairs of A. percula were fed either a high or a low food ration and their parental behaviours were monitored. Individuals exhibited plasticity in parental behaviour across the two resource environments. Furthermore, individuals were repeatable in their behaviour through time, as evidenced by significant among-individual variation in intercept. Finally, the slope and elevation of individual reaction norms varied, revealing a level of variation not captured at the population level and providing insight into the potential mechanisms generating individual variation.

### Description of Study Population
We conducted this study at Boston University (Boston, MA, U.S.A.) from 27 June 2014 through 22 June 2015. All experimental fish originated from natural populations of A. percula in Papua New Guinea and were supplied by Quality Marine. When they arrived in the laboratory, all individuals were under 30 mm standard length (SL), ensuring that they were collected as nonbreeders in the wild. At the start of this investigation, the individual fish had been in captivity for 3â€“4 years. We maintained the laboratory population of 60 pairs (120 individuals) of A. percula in a large, recirculating aquarium system at Boston University in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use protocol (IACUC number 14-006). Fish were housed in pairs in 120-litre tanks with the set of 60 tanks divided into four independent racks with 15 tanks per rack. Each of the four racks had its own pump that supplied a continuous flow of salt water recirculating at a rate of approximately 16 600 litres/h.

### Feeding Manipulation
To determine how parental care varies across different environments, we conducted a feeding manipulation. The feeding manipulation ran for 12 lunar months from 27 June 2014 through 22 June 2015. Pairs were fed a high ration of food (24 fish pellets per pair per day) for 6 lunar months and a low ration of food (12 fish pellets per pair per day) for another 6 lunar months. Ten pairs received the high ration treatment for the first 6 months and the low ration for the following 6 months. The other 10 pairs received the low ration first, followed by the high ration.

### Parental Care Measurements
During the 12-month experiment, the 20 pairs laid between zero and three clutches per month, with an average of 1.4 clutches per pair per month. We observed a total of 155 clutches across the 20 pairs, 51 clutches in the low-ration treatment and 104 clutches in the high-ration treatment and measured parental care for all 155 clutches. To investigate individual variation in parental behaviours, we quantified three metrics of care: time tending, mouthing and fanning. Time tending is the amount of time a parent is within one body length of any part of the clutch; mouthing occurs when a parent places their mouth around one or several eggs; and fanning occurs when a parent waves its pectoral fins in the direction of the clutch. For every clutch that was laid, we took 20 min videos of parental behaviour using high-resolution video cameras (GoPro Hero 4, GoPro Inc., San Mateo, CA, U.S.A.). The first 5 min of video served as an acclimation period and was discarded from our analysis, resulting in 15 min videos for data collection. Videos were taken at 1400 hours on days 1, 4 and 7 of egg development. Based on our observations of behaviour, mouthing and fanning were discrete events lasting less than 3 s, therefore we compiled data as the amount of time out of the 15 min that the focal individual was tending, and the number of mouthing and fanning events per 15 min video. Parental behaviours were recorded separately for the male and female of each pair.

### Description of Variables
